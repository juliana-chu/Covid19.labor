## Description

Covid19.labor is an R package to demonstrate components of a simple R package. This includes the main components: DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, man subdirectory and R subdirectory. Additionally, licence, README and subdirectories vignettes, tests, data and inst are also explored. The package is targeted for BCB410H students exploring development of an R package in bioinformatics.The goal of Covid19.labor is to display the patient  who has Covid19 by their Ethno-Racial Group, and their income levels by using the data that government gave.This will help to show which group of people have a larger chance getting effected.Whether it is by behavior, such as working environment, or  it is a generic problem, where there a gene that might effect individual have a higher chance to get effected. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of Covid19.labor from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::installgithub("juliana-chu/Covid19.labor",buildvignettes = TRUE)
library("Covid19.labor")
```

To run the Shiny app:

``` r
runCovid19.labor()
```
## Overview

Covid19.labor contains 6 functions and a data set to demonstrate components of a simple R package. All functions plot a graph, by rate/percentage, time period, income/nation group.The data set is from City of Toronto, and I have imported them into 7 datasets. The runCovid19.labor is the function that launches the shiny app for this package. Refer to package vignettes for more details.
